  abstract={Quasars are variable on timescales from days to years in UV/optical and generally appear bluer while they brighten. The physics behind the variations in fluxes and colors remains unclear. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey g - and r -band photometric monitoring data for quasars in Stripe 82, we find that although the flux variation amplitude increases with timescale, the color variability exhibits the opposite behavior. The color variability of quasars is prominent at timescales as short as ~10 days, but gradually reduces toward timescales up to years. In other words, the variable emission at shorter timescales is bluer than that at longer timescales. This timescale dependence is clearly and consistently detected at all redshifts from z = 0 to 3.5; thus, it cannot be due to contamination to broadband photometry from emission lines that do not respond to fast continuum variations. The discovery directly rules out the possibility that simply attributes the color variability to contamination from a non-variable redder component such as the host galaxy. It cannot be interpreted as changes in global accretion rate either. The thermal accretion disk fluctuation model is favored in the sense that fluctuations in the inner, hotter region of the disk are responsible for short-term variations, while longer-term and stronger variations are expected from the larger and cooler disk region. An interesting implication is that one can use quasar variations at different timescales to probe disk emission at different radii.}

  abstract={This is the second paper in a series on a new luminous z ∼ 5 quasar survey using optical and near-infrared colors. Here we present a new determination of the bright end of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at z ∼ 5. Combining our 45 new quasars with previously known quasars that satisfy our selections, we construct the largest uniform luminous z ∼ 5 quasar sample to date, with 99 quasars in the range of 4.7 ≤ z < 5.4 and−29 < M 1450 ≤ −26.8, within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint. We use a modified 1/ V a method including flux limit correction to derive a binned QLF, and we model the parametric QLF using maximum likelihood estimation. With the faint-end slope of the QLF fixed as α = −2.03 from previous deeper samples, the best fit of our QLF gives a flatter bright end slope β = −3.58 ± 0.24 and a fainter break magnitude ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/829/1/33/apjaa33fdieqn1.gif] {${M}_{1450}^{* }$}  = −26.98 ± 0.23 than previous studies at similar redshift. Combined with previous work at lower and higher redshifts, our result is consistent with a luminosity evolution and density evolution model. Using the best-fit QLF, the contribution of quasars to the ionizing background at z ∼ 5 is found to be 18%–45% with a clumping factor C of 2–5. Our sample suggests an evolution of radio loud fraction with optical luminosity but no obvious evolution with redshift.}

  abstract={We present initial results from the first systematic survey of luminous z ∼ 5.5 quasars. Quasars at z ∼ 5.5, the post-reionization epoch, are crucial tools to explore the evolution of intergalactic medium, quasar evolution, and the early super-massive black hole growth. However, it has been very challenging to select quasars at redshifts 5.3 ≤ z ≤ 5.7 using conventional color selections, due to their similar optical colors to late-type stars, especially M dwarfs, resulting in a glaring redshift gap in quasar redshift distributions. We develop a new selection technique for z ∼ 5.5 quasars based on optical, near-IR, and mid-IR photometric data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), UKIRT InfraRed Deep Sky Surveys—Large Area Survey (ULAS), VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS), and Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer . From our pilot observations in the SDSS-ULAS/VHS area, we have discovered 15 new quasars at 5.3 ≤ z ≤ 5.7 and 6 new lower redshift quasars, with SDSS z band magnitude brighter than 20.5. Including other two z ∼ 5.5 quasars already published in our previous work, we now construct a uniform quasar sample at 5.3 ≤ z ≤ 5.7, with 17 quasars in a ∼4800 square degree survey area. For further application in a larger survey area, we apply our selection pipeline to do a test selection by using the new wide field J-band photometric data from a preliminary version of the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey (UHS). We successfully discover the first UHS selected z ∼ 5.5 quasar.}

  abstract={We present a measurement of the Type I quasar luminosity function at z = 5 using a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed quasars selected from optical imaging data. We measure the bright end ( M 1450 < –26) with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data covering ~6000 deg 2 , then extend to lower luminosities ( M 1450 < –24) with newly discovered, faint z ~ 5 quasars selected from 235 deg 2 of deep, coadded imaging in the SDSS Stripe 82 region (the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap). The faint sample includes 14 quasars with spectra obtained as ancillary science targets in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, and 59 quasars observed at the MMT and Magellan telescopes. We construct a well-defined sample of 4.7 < z < 5.1 quasars that is highly complete, with 73 spectroscopic identifications out of 92 candidates. Our color selection method is also highly efficient: of the 73 spectra obtained, 71 are high-redshift quasars. These observations reach below the break in the luminosity function ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/768/2/105/apj468207ieqn1.gif] {$M_{1450}^*\approx -27$} ). The bright-end slope is steep (β ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} –4), with a constraint of β < –3.1 at 95% confidence. The break luminosity appears to evolve strongly at high redshift, providing an explanation for the flattening of the bright-end slope reported previously. We find a factor of ~2 greater decrease in the number density of luminous quasars ( M 1450 < –26) from z = 5 to z = 6 than from z = 4 to z = 5, suggesting a more rapid decline in quasar activity at high redshift than found in previous surveys. Our model for the quasar luminosity function predicts that quasars generate ~30% of the ionizing photons required to keep hydrogen in the universe ionized at z = 5.}

  abstract={We describe the first data release from the Spitzer -IRAC Equatorial Survey (SpIES); a large-area survey of ∼115 deg 2 in the Equatorial SDSS Stripe 82 field using Spitzer during its “warm” mission phase. SpIES was designed to probe sufficient volume to perform measurements of quasar clustering and the luminosity function at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/225/1/1/apjs523397ieqn1.gif] {$z\;\geqslant $} 3 to test various models for “feedback” from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Additionally, the wide range of available multi-wavelength, multi-epoch ancillary data enables SpIES to identify both high-redshift ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/225/1/1/apjs523397ieqn2.gif] {$z\;\geqslant $} 5) quasars as well as obscured quasars missed by optical surveys. SpIES achieves 5 σ depths of 6.13 μ Jy (21.93 AB magnitude) and 5.75 μ Jy (22.0 AB magnitude) at 3.6 and 4.5 μ m, respectively—depths significantly fainter than the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ). We show that the SpIES survey recovers a much larger fraction of spectroscopically confirmed quasars (∼98%) in Stripe 82 than are recovered by WISE (∼55%). This depth is especially powerful at high-redshift ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/225/1/1/apjs523397ieqn3.gif] {$z\;\geqslant 3.5$} ), where SpIES recovers 94% of confirmed quasars, whereas WISE only recovers 25%. Here we define the SpIES survey parameters and describe the image processing, source extraction, and catalog production methods used to analyze the SpIES data. In addition to this survey paper, we release 234 images created by the SpIES team and three detection catalogs: a 3.6 μ m only detection catalog containing ∼6.1 million sources, a 4.5 μ m only detection catalog containing ∼6.5 million sources, and a dual-band detection catalog containing ∼5.4 million sources.}

  abstract={We quantify quasar color variability using an unprecedented variability database— ugriz photometry of 9093 quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82, observed over 8 years at ~60 epochs each. We confirm previous reports that quasars become bluer when brightening. We find a redshift dependence of this blueing in a given set of bands (e.g., g and r ), but show that it is the result of the flux contribution from less-variable or delayed emission lines in the different SDSS bands at different redshifts. After correcting for this effect, quasar color variability is remarkably uniform, and independent not only of redshift, but also of quasar luminosity and black hole mass. The color variations of individual quasars, as they vary in brightness on year timescales, are much more pronounced than the ranges in color seen in samples of quasars across many orders of magnitude in luminosity. This indicates distinct physical mechanisms behind quasar variability and the observed range of quasar luminosities at a given black hole mass—quasar variations cannot be explained by changes in the mean accretion rate. We do find some dependence of the color variability on the characteristics of the flux variations themselves, with fast, low-amplitude, brightness variations producing more color variability. The observed behavior could arise if quasar variability results from flares or ephemeral hot spots in an accretion disk.}

The transient, iPTF 16bco, was detected by iPTF in the nucleus of a galaxy with an archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum with weak narrow-line emission characteristic of a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). Our follow-up spectra show the dramatic appearance of broad Balmer lines and a power-law continuum characteristic of a luminous ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/835/2/144/apjaa5425ieqn1.gif] {${L}_{\mathrm{bol}}\approx {10}^{45}$} erg s −1 ) type 1 quasar 12 yr later. Our photometric monitoring with PTF from 2009–2012 and serendipitous X-ray observations from the XMM-Newton Slew Survey in 2011 and 2015 constrain the change of state to have occurred less than 500 days before the iPTF detection. An enhanced broad H α /[O iii ] λ 5007 line ratio in the type 1 state relative to other changing-look quasars also is suggestive of the most rapid change of state yet observed in a quasar. We argue that the >10 increase in Eddington ratio inferred from the brightening in UV and X-ray continuum flux is more likely due to an intrinsic change in the accretion rate of a preexisting accretion disk than an external mechanism such as variable obscuration, microlensing, or the tidal disruption of a star. However, further monitoring will be helpful in better constraining the mechanism driving this change of state. The rapid “turn-on” of the quasar is much shorter than the viscous infall timescale of an accretion disk and requires a disk instability that can develop around a ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/835/2/144/apjaa5425ieqn2.gif] {$\sim {10}^{8}\,{M}_{\odot }$} black hole on timescales less than 1 yr.}

  abstract={Hundreds of Type 2 quasars have been identified in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, and there is substantial evidence that they are generally galaxies with highly obscured central engines, in accord with unified models for active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A straightforward expectation of unified models is that highly obscured Type 2 AGNs should show little or no optical variability on timescales of days to years. As a test of this prediction, we have carried out a search for variability in Type 2 quasars in SDSS Stripe 82 using difference-imaging photometry. Starting with the Type 2 AGN catalogs of Zakamska et al. and Reyes et al., we find evidence of significant g -band variability in 17 out of 173 objects for which light curves could be measured from the Stripe 82 data. To determine the nature of this variability, we obtained new Keck spectropolarimetry observations for seven of these variable AGNs. The Keck data show that these objects have low continuum polarizations ( p ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1% in most cases) and all seven have broad Hα and/or Mg II emission lines in their total (unpolarized) spectra, indicating that they should actually be classified as Type 1 AGNs. We conclude that the primary reason variability is found in the SDSS-selected Type 2 AGN samples is that these samples contain a small fraction of Type 1 AGNs as contaminants, and it is not necessary to invoke more exotic possible explanations such as a population of "naked" or unobscured Type 2 quasars. Aside from misclassified Type 1 objects, the Type 2 quasars do not generally show detectable optical variability over the duration of the Stripe 82 survey.}

The resultant products are co-added science images and their associated weight images that record relative weights at individual pixels. The depths of the co-adds, measured as the 5σ detection limits of the aperture (3.''2 diameter) magnitudes for point sources, are roughly 23.9, 25.1, 24.6, 24.1, and 22.8 AB magnitudes in the five bands, respectively. They are 1.9-2.2 mag deeper than the best SDSS single-epoch data. The co-added images have good image quality, with an average point-spread function FWHM of ~1'' in the r , i , and z bands. We also release object catalogs that were made with SExtractor. These co-added products have many potential uses for studies of galaxies, quasars, and Galactic structure. We further present and release near-IR J -band images that cover ~90 deg 2 of Stripe 82. These images were obtained using the NEWFIRM camera on the NOAO 4 m Mayall telescope, and have a depth of about 20.0-20.5 Vega magnitudes (also 5σ detection limits for point sources).}

They span a wide luminosity range of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn7.gif] {$-29.0\leqslant {M}_{1450}\leqslant -24.5$} . This well-defined sample is used to derive the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn8.gif] {$z\sim 6$} . After combining our SDSS sample with two faint ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn9.gif] {${M}_{1450}\geqslant -23$} mag) quasars from the literature, we obtain the parameters for a double power-law fit to the QLF. The bright-end slope β of the QLF is well constrained to be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn10.gif] {$\beta =-2.8\pm 0.2$} . Due to the small number of low-luminosity quasars, the faint-end slope α and the characteristic magnitude ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn11.gif] {${M}_{1450}^{* }$} are less well constrained, with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn12.gif] {$\alpha =-{1.90}_{-0.44}^{+0.58}$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn13.gif] {${M}^{* }=-{25.2}_{-3.8}^{+1.2}$} mag. The spatial density of luminous quasars, parametrized as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn14.gif] {$\rho ({M}_{1450}\lt -26,z)=\rho (z=6){10}^{k(z-6)}$} , drops rapidly from ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn15.gif] {$z\sim 5$} to 6, with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn16.gif] {$k=-0.72\pm 0.11$} . Based on our fitted QLF and assuming an intergalactic medium (IGM) clumping factor of C = 3, we find that the observed quasar population cannot provide enough photons to ionize the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/833/2/222/apjaa4776ieqn17.gif] {$z\sim 6$} IGM at ∼90% confidence. Quasars may still provide a significant fraction of the required photons, although much larger samples of faint quasars are needed for more stringent constraints on the quasar contribution to reionization.}

  abstract={This paper introduces the multiband periodogram , a general extension of the well-known Lomb–Scargle approach for detecting periodic signals in time-domain data. In addition to advantages of the Lomb–Scargle method such as treatment of non-uniform sampling and heteroscedastic errors, the multiband periodogram significantly improves period finding for randomly sampled multiband light curves (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DES, and LSST). The light curves in each band are modeled as arbitrary truncated Fourier series, with the period and phase shared across all bands. The key aspect is the use of Tikhonov regularization which drives most of the variability into the so-called base model common to all bands, while fits for individual bands describe residuals relative to the base model and typically require lower-order Fourier series. This decrease in the effective model complexity is the main reason for improved performance. After a pedagogical development of the formalism of least-squares spectral analysis, which motivates the essential features of the multiband model, we use simulated light curves and randomly subsampled SDSS Stripe 82 data to demonstrate the superiority of this method compared to other methods from the literature and find that this method will be able to efficiently determine the correct period in the majority of LSST’s bright RR Lyrae stars with as little as six months of LSST data, a vast improvement over the years of data reported to be required by previous studies. A Python implementation of this method, along with code to fully reproduce the results reported here, is available on GitHub.}

	Abstract = {We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a catalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS stripe 82, which lies along the celestial equator in the southern Galactic hemisphere (22 h 24 m < Î± J2000.0 < 04 h 08 m , -1.27$\,^{\circ}$ < ÎŽ J2000.0 < +1.27$\,^{\circ}$, ~290 deg 2 ), and contains 34 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz system for 748,084 unresolved sources at high Galactic latitudes ( b < -20$\,^{\circ}$) that were observed at least four times in each of the ugri bands (with a median of 10 observations obtained over ~6 yr). In each photometric bandpass we compute various low-order light-curve statistics, such as rms scatter, Ï 2 per degree of freedom, skewness, and minimum and maximum magnitude, and use them to select and study variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter than g = 20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g and r bands (at high Galactic latitudes). The majority (2 out of 3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2) quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the 0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for finding low-redshift quasars as the UV excess color selection (at high Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of light-curve skewness for quasars and find that it is centered on zero. We find that about one-fourth of the variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of light-curve skewness in the g - r versus u - g color-color diagram on the main stellar locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like behavior). Using over 600 RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to the expected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that it will obtain well-sampled, 2% accurate, multicolor light curves for ~2 million low-redshift quasars and discover at least 50 million variable stars.},

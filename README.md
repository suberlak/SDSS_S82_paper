# SDSS_S82_paper

A repository describing research on the SDSS Stripe 82 data reprocessed in the Summer 2013 as part of the [LSST Data Challenge](https://dmtn-035.lsst.io) (also see notes 
[here](https://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/wiki/DC/Winter2013)). It is accompanied by two technical papers : on the [faint fluxe pipeline](https://github.com/suberlak/Faint_pipeline_report), and on [variability detection methods](https://github.com/suberlak/Variability_report).
